I needed to adjust headlights on my Ford Crown Victoria after installing HID lights, but found that it is almost impossible to get there with a socket wrench. There is even special tool for it, but it costs $20 and you have to wait a week for delivery...

This tool gets on the adjustment bolt and allow you to use your bare hands to tighten it. Takes just seconds to adjust it, once you are done printing.

I read that many other cars use same size of the hex bolt, but different cars might have different clearances. Attached is Freecad source file you can modify anytime to fit your particular car.

PS: holes on the side were initially put by me to allow using something to spin it if bolt get stuck, but it turned out using just hands is enough.
