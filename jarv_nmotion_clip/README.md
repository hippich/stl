Jarv Nmotion T-Shirt Clip
=========================

I really like my Jarv Nmotion headset, but hate when I am boxing or jumping remote tries to pull headset away from my ears. So I created this clip which I am using to attach remote to my t-shirt during training.

It clicks into usb connector, so you don't need anything special to mount it. It is designed for mounting remote behind your head, so it might not work as well if you prefer to keep remote in front.
