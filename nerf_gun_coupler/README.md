Nerf Dart Gun Tactical Rail Custom Accessory Joiner Coupler
===========================================================

I created this design from scratch to allow mounting second Nerf gun on a tactical rail of bigger rifle.
This design allows you to aim thanks to large window in the middle of the coupler. Another addition - small
bump which clutch in to stock tactical rail notch (where available.) I also added cool Lightning Bolt on
the sides, but I can customize it.
